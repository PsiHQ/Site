This is in direct contrast to the standard model and our current models of the Big Bang which lead to equal amounts of both; yet, the imbalance is undeniable.</p> <p>One way to arrive at the observed asymmetry is for the early universe to satisfy a set of three distinct conditions &#40;the Sakharov conditions&#41; - these include violation of C and CP symmetries, violation of the baryon number and, finally, a departure from thermal equilibrium in the early universe. Electroweak symmetry breaking - or, the process by which the Higgs field chooses a potential minimum and grants other particles their masses - can, in principle, satisfy these conditions; however, in the standard model of particle physics with only one Higgs particle, the resulting asymmetry is much smaller than the observed one. This calls for beyond standard model scenarios and an interesting solution in this context is provided by the extended Higgs sector, i.e., the standard model with additional Higgs particles.</p> <p>This was the primary idea I worked on under Prof. Shinya Kanemura &#40;personal website <a href="http://www-het.phys.sci.osaka-u.ac.jp/~kanemu/index_eng.html">here</a>&#41; at Osaka University as an ISP student during the summer of 2024. I looked into aspects of spontaneous symmetry breaking and the Higgs sector, specifically focusing on the baryon asymmetry issue. I investigated the effects of finite temperature on quantum field theories, particularly in the context of the <strong>two Higgs doublet model</strong> &#40;THDM&#41;, and looked at how this leads to the possibility of a phase transition at high temperatures &#40;in the early stages of the universe&#41;. Such phase transitions hold the key to satisfying the Sakharov conditions. I also considered two broad approaches to probing such models:</p> <ol> <li><p><strong>Collider perspective</strong> - calculating the loop corrections to the couplings using effective potential techniques that could be observed in collider experiments.</p> <li><p><strong>Cosmological perspective</strong> - feasibility of detecting GWs generated due to bubble collisions during the electroweak phase transition in such theories. </p> </ol> <p>A report summarising the main aspects of the project can be found <a href="/Site/assets/SSB_ISP_2024.pdf" download=SSB_ISP_2024 >here.</a> <div class=row > <div class=container > <center><img src="/Site/assets/ISP_cont_Julia.svg" width = "300" height = "300"></center> <p style = "font-size: 15px">A depiction of the deviation in the trilinear Higgs coupling in the THDM compared to the SM. As shown, these deviations can be significant and, therefore, observable in future collider experiments. This allows for testing the validity of various extended Higgs sector models against physical observations. </p> </div> </p> <p><a href="/Site/menu1/">‚Üê Back</a></p> <div class=page-foot > <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA 4.0</a> shihabulhaque.
