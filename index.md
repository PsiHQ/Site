    Hi, I'm Shihabul Haque, a PhD student in the Theoretical Particle Physics (TPP) group at the International School for Advanced Studies (SISSA) in Trieste, Italy, starting October 2025. I am broadly interested in different areas of high energy physics.

Welcome to my personal page! I recently graduated with an Integrated BS-MS from the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science (IACS), and am heading to SISSA's Theoretical Particle Physics group for my PhD this fall.

I use this website to share a bit about myself, especially my academic journey, research interests and some other stuff that I find interesting. Feel free to look around and please reach out if you want to connect and discuss something - feedback is always appreciated!
## Research interests

My research revolves around **theoretical high energy physics** and I am interested in different aspects of this broad and ever-evolving field, including particle phenomenology, quantum field theories and the interface between particle physics and cosmology. Some of the recent questions I've worked on include:

1. **Multi-ALP theories and axion echoes** - theoretically deriving an estimate of the echo signal in theories with multiple axion-like particles (ALPs) in a model-independent way.
2. **Randall-Sundrum (RS) models and link between the hierarchy problem and ALPs** - based on earlier literature on ALPs originating from a Kalb-Ramond field in warped geometries, I calculated the predicted ALP/photon coupling strength assuming the RS solution to the hierarchy problem and compared it to current experimental bounds.
3. **Electroweak phase transitions in the early universe** - explored cosmological (gravitational wave) and collider probes of the two Higgs doublet model during my brief visit to Osaka University.

As a fresh undergrad at IACS, I also explored nonlinear dynamics and some aspects of weak measurements. More details can be found on the [research](/menu1/) page.

I am also a big fan of Julia - something I picked up more or less as a hobby though now it is essential part of my work. This website, for instance, was built in Julia using Franklin.jl, thanks to some helpful tutorials I found online!

## Beyond physics

I come from Kolkata, India’s City of Joy and cultural capital, where I completed both my schooling and my Integrated BS-MS at IACS, graduating in 2025 with a physics major.

When I'm not doing physics, you’ll find me holed up with a book - I’m a huge fan of the crime/thriller genre (think *Poirot*!). I also enjoy writing - essays, opinion pieces, or the occasional story. Recently, I've been thinking about making science more accessible through lucid writing and clear presentation. I find writing relaxing and helpful - faux therapeutic. I also regularly follow the English Premier League and have been a long-suffering but loyal Chelsea supporter, through the good, the bad, and the outright hilarious.

You can visit the [research](/menu1/) page to check out my interests and past experiences or [this](/menu2/) page for a look at my C.V. - you can also contact me using the information provided [here](/menu3/). 

Thank you for visiting and have a nice day!
