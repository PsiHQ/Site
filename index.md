Welcome to my page - here, you will find snippets about me, my interests, my work and more! Feel free to explore and contact me if needed - feedback is appreciated!

At present, I am a 5th year student at the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science, Kolkata (IACS). I am a theoretical physics major and specialise in **particle physics**.

## Research interests

I aspire to be a theoretical physicist and, as of now, I am mostly into **_theoretical high-energy physics_**, including both phenomenology and more fundamental aspects. I have also had exposure to different fields at IACS - *nonlinear systems*, *weak measurements* and so on. The [research](/menu1/) page elaborates on this further, so please visit it if interested.

On a computational side, I have self-learned Julia as a side interest and hobby - it has now become an integral part of my work. Interestingly, I built this webpage with Julia as well! It's super interesting and super fun.
