## Weak measurements in quantum theory
My curiosity in quantum mechanics was piqued ever since I read Anil Ananthaswamy's _Through Two Doors at Once_ (on the many interpretations of the quantum theory through the 
double slit experiment) - J. J. Sakurai's _Modern Quantum Mechanics_, in particular, is one of my favourite textbooks. I wrote a term paper as part of my curricula on the 
double slit experiment in classical and quantum contexts, taking inspiration from Richard Feynman's belief that the whole of quantum theory was hidden in that one singular 
experiment.

I visited the _Chennai Mathematical Institute_ in the summer of 2023 to work on weak measurements in quantum theory under Prof. H. S. Mani (personal page 
[here](https://www.cmi.ac.in/people/fac-profile.php?id=hsmani)). I looked at basic **measurement theory** in quantum physics, the 
[_Albert-Aharonov-Vaidman_ paper](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.60.1351) and its later interpretations. I focused 
on the conceptual idea of weak measurements and their relation to interference and calculated weak values for certain observables in simple systems - spin-1 particles, 
oscillator potentials and so on. A report covering certain aspects of this project is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HJdwubqbF81JADzQ5HN3f-iTtnlY1klo/view?usp=sharing).

## The solar neutrino problem and more
I had some exposure to particle physics during my undergrad - I wrote a term paper on the **solar neutrino problem** in my first year (available 
[here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s0cYTZZvwxv6wJApdP2BAUXGybRgws1c/view?usp=sharing)) and got interested in the idea of neutrino oscillations. Later, I spent the summer 
of 2022 on some related but basic topics - Dirac equation, spinors, neutrino mass models - under Prof. Amitava Raychaudhuri
([INSPIRE](https://inspirehep.net/authors/992176?ui-citation-summary=true&ui-exclude-self-citations=true)) at the _Raja Bazaar Science College_, Kolkata. Of course, I later dealt with most of these ideas in detail when I was taking my QFT I and II courses, but the early exposure did help with making some of the mathematical tools a bit familiar.
