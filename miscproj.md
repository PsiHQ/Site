## Weak measurements in quantum theory
My curiosity in quantum mechanics was piqued ever since I read Anil Ananthaswamy's _Through Two Doors at Once_ (on the many interpretations of the quantum theory through the 
double slit experiment) - J. J. Sakurai's _Modern Quantum Mechanics_, in particular, is one of my favourite textbooks. I wrote a term paper as part of my curricula on the 
double slit experiment in classical and quantum contexts, taking inspiration from Richard Feynman's belief that the whole of quantum theory was hidden in that one singular 
experiment.

I visited the _Chennai Mathematical Institute_ in the summer of 2023 to work on weak measurements in quantum theory under Prof. H. S. Mani (personal page 
[here](https://www.cmi.ac.in/people/fac-profile.php?id=hsmani)). I looked at basic **measurement theory** in quantum physics, the 
[_Albert-Aharonov-Vaidman_ paper](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.60.1351) and its later interpretations. I focused 
on the conceptual idea of weak measurements and their relation to interference and calculated weak values for certain observables in simple systems - spin-1 particles, 
oscillator potentials and so on. A report covering certain aspects of this project is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HJdwubqbF81JADzQ5HN3f-iTtnlY1klo/view?usp=sharing).

## The solar neutrino problem and more
I had some exposure to particle physics during my undergrad - I wrote a term paper on the **solar neutrino problem** in my first year and got interested in the idea of neutrino oscillations. Later, I spent the summer 
of 2022 on some related but basic topics - Dirac equation, spinors, neutrino mass models - under Prof. Amitava Raychaudhuri
([INSPIRE](https://inspirehep.net/authors/992176?ui-citation-summary=true&ui-exclude-self-citations=true)) at the _Raja Bazaar Science College_, Kolkata. Of course, I later dealt with most of these ideas in detail when I was taking my QFT I and II courses, but the early exposure did help with making some of the mathematical tools a bit familiar. 

## Term papers and notes
The list below includes a couple of term papers I wrote during my very early undergrad years (mostly as a part of coursework requirements, even though I quite enjoyed this process as it helped me deepen my understanding too). These aren’t “research papers” in any formal sense, though I did review quite a bit of literature to write them. They’re also not especially technical, as my mathematical background was not as developed at the time.

: This was a term paper I wrote as a second year student at IACS after being haunted by Feynman's comments on the double slit experiment holding the central mystery to quantum physics. it offers (in my opinion) a fairly lucid exposition of Young’s experiment and its later quantum interpretations - including some standard quantum mechanics formalism, so it’s not entirely non-technical either.

: This term paper dates back to 2021 (when I was a first year student). It talks about the solar neutrino problem from a non-technical perspective. Do note that it's a bit rough around the edges - this was the first term paper I ever wrote.

I typically prefer taking notes on paper, but I might upload a few more expository things here later, if I get the time.
