# Two Higgs Doublet Model and the Electroweak Phase Transition
One of the biggest puzzles in modern physics is the **baryon asymmetry problem**: the observation that our universe seems to comprise of unequal amounts of matter and anti-matter.
This is in direct contrast to the standard model and our current models of the Big Bang which lead to equal amounts of both; yet, the imbalance is undeniable.

One way to arrive at the observed asymmetry is for the early universe to satisfy a set of three distinct conditions (the Sakharov conditions) - these include violation of C and CP
symmetries, violation of the baryon number and, finally, a departure from thermal equilibrium in the early universe. Electroweak symmetry breaking - or, the process by which the
Higgs field chooses a potential minimum and grants other particles their masses - can, in principle, satisfy these conditions; however, in the standard model of particle physics with
only one Higgs particle, the resulting asymmetry is much smaller than the observed one. This calls for beyond standard model scenarios and an interesting solution in this context
is provided by the extended Higgs sector, i.e., the standard model with additional Higgs particles.

This was the primary idea I worked on under Prof. Shinya Kanemura (personal website [here](http://www-het.phys.sci.osaka-u.ac.jp/~kanemu/index_eng.html)) at Osaka University as an ISP student during the 
summer of 2024. I looked into aspects of spontaneous symmetry breaking and the Higgs sector, specifically focusing on the baryon asymmetry issue. I investigated the 
effects of finite temperature on quantum field theories, particularly in the context of the **two Higgs doublet model** (THDM), and looked at how this leads to the possibility 
of a phase transition at high temperatures (in the early stages of the universe). Such phase transitions hold the key to satisfying the Sakharov conditions. I also considered 
two broad approaches to probing such models:

1. **Collider perspective** - calculating the loop corrections to the couplings using effective potential techniques that could be observed in collider experiments.
2. **Cosmological perspective** - feasibility of detecting GWs generated due to bubble collisions during the electroweak phase transition in such theories.
