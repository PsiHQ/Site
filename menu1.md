# Research
My primary research interest lies in theoretical physics, particularly high energy physics - particle phenomenology, model-building, quantum field theories and so on. As a student at IACS, I explored two broad areas: nonlinear dynamics during my undergraduate years and particle phenomenology for my final two years BS-MS project work.

Here is a brief overview of the projects I've undertaken over the last few years. You can find further details, including arXivs and reports, on the individual project pages:

1. [**Axion-like particles (ALPs) in various contexts**](/axions/) - The crux of my BS-MS project focused on ALPs, especially the ALP-photon interaction term and its consequences. My work ranged from ALP-photon mixing in astrophysical situations to axion echoes, multiple ALP theories and the Randall-Sundrum (RS) warped geometry model. While the problem differed in each of the four semesters, the approach remained the same: to focus on specific consequences of the ALP/photon coupling term and probe for observational signatures, sometimes in simple models of the intergalactic magnetic field and sometimes in RS models. Please visit [this](/axions/) for more details.

2. [**Electroweak phase transitions in the two Higgs doublet model**](/thdm/) - I was selected for the International Summer Program at Osaka University for the summer of 2024 where I explored electroweak phase transitions in the early universe, specifically in extended Higgs sector models like the two Higgs doublet model (THDM), with a focus on the baryon asymmetry problem and how a finite temperature effect can effectively cause a departure from thermal equilibrium, satisfying one of the Sakharov conditions and leading to a possibility of proper baryogenesis in the THDM. More details, as well as the project report, can be found [here](/thdm/).

3. [**Nonlinear oscillators and parametric resonances**](/nonlin/) - I worked on several small nonlinear projects voluntarily under Prof. Jayanta K. Bhattacharjee at IACS during my undergraduate years. These projects ranged from analysing simple dynamical systems using perturbative techniques to analytically approximating more involved nonlinear oscillators around their resonance points. While quite different from my later particle physics focus on the surface, my initial training in nonlinear physics made me much more comfortable in a lot of mathematical techniques (for example, perturbative expansions) while also helping me build a computational base. For a description of the projects I undertook during this time and their outcomes, please visit [this](/nonlin/) page.

4. [**Other miscellaneous projects**](/miscproj/) - This page describes a few brief side projects undertaken during my undergraduate years at IACS. These range from weak measurements in quantum physics to the solar neutrino problem and neutrinos.
