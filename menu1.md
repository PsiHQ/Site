# Research

As someone who likes a fair bit of maths, I am interested in the theoretical side of physics. I am specifically interested in **_particle physics_** and **_high-energy phenomena_**, the field my BS-MS project is based in. I work on **_axion/photon mixing_** and some related phenomena for my BS-MS project but, aside from that, I also worked a bit on aspects of the **_two Higgs doublet model_** and **_electroweak phase transition_** during my stay at Osaka University.

At the same time, I have played around with other areas too - **_nonlinear dynamics_**, **_quantum physics_** and **_gravity_**. On this page, you will find a broad description of my interests and exposure. See [test](/axions/), [test2](/thdm/).

## Neutrinos, Higgs and ALPs

### The solar neutrino problem and more

I had some exposure to particle physics during my undergrad - I wrote a term paper on the **solar neutrino problem** in my first year (available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1s0cYTZZvwxv6wJApdP2BAUXGybRgws1c/view?usp=sharing)) and got interested in the idea of neutrino oscillations. Later, I spent the summer of 2022 on some related but basic topics - Dirac equation, spinors, neutrino mass models - under Prof. Amitava Raychaudhuri ([INSPIRE](https://inspirehep.net/authors/992176?ui-citation-summary=true&ui-exclude-self-citations=true)) at the _Raja Bazaar Science College_, Kolkata. 

### Two Higgs doublet model and electroweak PT

I worked under Prof. Shinya Kanemura (personal website [here](http://www-het.phys.sci.osaka-u.ac.jp/~kanemu/index_eng.html)) at Osaka University as an ISP student during the summer of 2024. I mostly looked into aspects of spontaneous symmetry breaking and the Higgs sector, specifically focusing on the **baryon asymmetry issue**. I investigated the effects of finite temperature on quantum field theories, particularly in the context of the **two Higgs doublet model** (THDM), and looked at how this leads to the possibility of a phase transition at high temperatures (in the early stages of the universe). Such phase transitions are necessary to satisfy the Sakharov conditions. I also considered two broad approaches to probing the feasibility of such models - namely, the loop corrections to the couplings using effective potential techniques that can be observed in collider experiments and the possibility of detecting GWs generated due to bubble collisions during the electroweak phase transition in such theories. A report summarising the main aspects of the project can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-L7yvdlQTgaTtF5vlT9OmbW7JVK9FXqF/view?usp=sharing) (most of the links here redirect to Google Drive).

### Axions, gravitons and photons

My 2 years BS-MS project, under Prof. Sourov Roy at IACS (personal website [here](https://www.iacs.res.in/athusers/index.php?navid=0&userid=IACS0070)), is on axions - super light, weakly interacting particles that are there but maybe not there and which might make up dark matter - and how they interact with light. I read up on some of the existing literature on **axion/photon coupling**, specifically focusing on the consequences of the mixing and replicated **polarisation-based studies** - which essentially involves looking at how the properties of light from distant galaxies and astrophysical objects (like quasars) change when observed on Earth and how particles like axions could be responsible for such changes. This has both observational aspects and theoretical and/or computational aspects (the latter of which is what I do). A report on this, based on the first semester of the project, can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Mvn49nclGL092knNy2W4bLjMpHHaebw9/view?usp=sharing).

For my second semester, I looked at a closely related phenomenon - the **mixing of gravitational waves and photons**. Once linearised, the formalism is similar to the axion/photon case. Much of my project focused on similar polarisation changes in light that might result from such an oscillation phenomenon and how it might be applied to real-life observations. At present, I am looking into a certain class of extra-dimensional theories and how they might be related to these phenomena - this latter part of my work can be accessed in the arXiv preprint [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08396). 

## Nonlinear systems, parametric resonances and oscillators (spoiler alert: _lots_ of oscillators!)

At IACS, I worked with Prof. Jayanta K. Bhattacharjee (who you can see on the homepage!) on nonlinear systems for around a year before he left for IIT, Kanpur, after which we collaborated (and still collaborate) online. Broadly, my work with him can be categorised into three separate intervals. 

### Nonlinear systems

Initially, I worked on simple nonlinear systems and looked at some interesting aspects of their dynamics. As a fresh undergrad, this familiarised me with **_approximating techniques_**, **_differential equations_**, ideas like **_linearization_**, **_fixed points_** and so on.

I worked on forced oscillators around resonance and learnt to use **perturbative techniques** to identify their resonant frequencies. I applied certain techniques (like **Krylov Bogolioubov averaging**) to determine approximate analytical solutions around resonance. 

A report on the more interesting aspects of this work can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1p-KbWKduVuJ_uCbAs4RP9Ig1QYUXwiLs/view?usp=sharing).

### Parametric resonances in more complicated systems

In the latter part of 2022, I worked with my classmate, Nilanjan, and Prof. Bhattacharjee on an **elastic double pendulum** - a 6-dimensional system. We identified four resonance conditions using perturbative techniques (two of which, to the best of our knowledge, were not analysed in existing literature). We looked at the numerical solutions at resonance and briefly investigated the chaotic aspects of the system by computationally estimating the Lyapunov exponent. Unfortunately, due to the system's complexity, deriving an approximate analytical expression proved challenging. 

I presented our work on the elastic double pendulum at **NODYCON 2023**, held in Rome (unfortunately, I had to present remotely due to personal constraints). The abstract we submitted can be found [here](https://nodycon.org/2023/papers/192/abstract_submissions/621/view_abstract) (link to the official NODYCON abstract page). The presentation slides can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mbIAuIR7-caTrRZmpBVEsR98N7OOSJdQ/view?usp=sharing). The published chapter after peer-review can be accessed [here](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-50631-4_12).

### Bounded solutions and forced oscillators

While working on the elastic double pendulum, Prof. Bhattacharjee and I became interested in a different problem - the simple **forced undamped oscillator**. It has a very well-known resonance condition and its behaviour around this point is known (in the linear order). Yet, the linear order solution diverges while the actual equation does not - we looked at the system perturbatively and found, surprisingly, that such finite solutions can be explained, even in undamped cases, by an interesting camaraderie between the amplitudes in various orders leading to a **destructive interference like effect** - just as in the case of light! Furthermore, we found that the amplitude and the time period of the oscillations are drive-dependent and follow some interesting power laws - this only happens in a specific interval of drive magnitude after which the oscillator tends to become more and more messy - a first-order phase transition! This work resulted in a peer-reviewed publication - you can find it [here](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1751-8121/ad6412). The arXiv preprint code for the manuscript is [2305.04125](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04125).

## Weak measurements and quantum theory

My curiosity in quantum theory was piqued ever since I read Anil Ananthaswamy's _Through Two Doors at Once_ (on the many interpretations of the quantum theory through the double slit experiment) - J. J. Sakurai's _Modern Quantum Mechanics_, in particular, is one of my favourite textbooks. I wrote a term paper as part of my curricula on the double slit experiment in classical and quantum contexts, taking inspiration from Richard Feynman's belief that the whole of quantum theory was hidden in that one singular experiment.

I visited the _Chennai Mathematical Institute_ in the summer of 2023 to work on weak measurements in quantum theory under Prof. H. S. Mani. I looked at basic **measurement theory** in quantum physics, the [_Albert-Aharonov-Vaidman_ paper](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.60.1351) and its later interpretations. I focused on the conceptual idea of weak measurements and their relation to interference and calculated weak values for certain observables in simple systems - spin-1 particles, oscillator potentials and so on. A report covering certain aspects of this project is available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HJdwubqbF81JADzQ5HN3f-iTtnlY1klo/view?usp=sharing).
