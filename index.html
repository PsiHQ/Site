I am broadly interested in different areas of high energy physics. </span> <p style = "color:white"> ------------- <br> </p> <p style = "font-size: 15px"> <i>Left:</i> Togetsukyō Bridge, Kyoto, Japan, 2024. Taken during my participation in Osaka University's International Summer Program. </p> <div style="clear: both"></div> </div> </div> Welcome to my personal page&#33; I recently graduated with an Integrated BS-MS from the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science &#40;IACS&#41;, and am heading to SISSA&#39;s Theoretical Particle Physics group for my PhD this fall.</p> <p>I use this website to share a bit about myself, especially my academic journey, research interests and some other stuff that I find interesting. Feel free to look around and please reach out if you want to connect and discuss something - feedback is always appreciated&#33;</p> <h2 id=research_interests ><a href="#research_interests" class=header-anchor >Research interests</a></h2> <p>My research revolves around <strong>theoretical high energy physics</strong> and I am interested in different aspects of this broad and ever-evolving field, including particle phenomenology, quantum field theories and the interface between particle physics and cosmology. Some of the recent questions I&#39;ve worked on include:</p> <ol> <li><p><strong>Multi-ALP theories and axion echoes</strong> - theoretically deriving an estimate of the echo signal in theories with multiple axion-like particles &#40;ALPs&#41; in a model-independent way.</p> <li><p><strong>Randall-Sundrum &#40;RS&#41; models and link between the hierarchy problem and ALPs</strong> - based on earlier literature on ALPs originating from a Kalb-Ramond field in warped geometries, I calculated the predicted ALP/photon coupling strength assuming the RS solution to the hierarchy problem and compared it to current experimental bounds.</p> <li><p><strong>Electroweak phase transitions in the early universe</strong> - explored cosmological &#40;gravitational wave&#41; and collider probes of the two Higgs doublet model during my brief visit to Osaka University.</p> </ol> <p>As a fresh undergrad at IACS, I also explored nonlinear dynamics and some aspects of weak measurements. More details can be found on the <a href="/Site/menu1/">research</a> page.</p> <p>I am also a big fan of Julia - something I picked up more or less as a hobby though now it is an essential part of my work. This website, for instance, was built in Julia using Franklin.jl, thanks to some helpful tutorials I found online&#33;</p> <div class=row > <div class=container > <center><img src="/Site/assets/jkb.jpeg" width = "300" height = "300"></center> <p style = "font-size: 15px"> <i> With Prof. Jayanta K.

I also enjoy writing - essays, opinion pieces, or the occasional story. Recently, I&#39;ve been thinking about making science more accessible through lucid writing and clear presentation. I find writing relaxing and helpful - faux therapeutic. I also regularly follow the English Premier League and have been a Chelsea supporter, through the good, the bad, and the outright hilarious.</p> <p>You can visit the <a href="/Site/menu1/">research</a> page to check out my interests and past experiences or <a href="/Site/menu2/">this</a> page for a look at my C.V. - you can also contact me using the information provided <a href="/Site/menu3/">here</a>. </p> <p>Thank you for visiting and have a nice day&#33;</p> <p>&#40;<em>Heads up - this site is not very mobile friendly.
