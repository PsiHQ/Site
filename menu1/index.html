Later, I spent the summer of 2022 on some related but basic topics - Dirac equation, spinors, neutrino mass models - under Prof. Amitava Raychaudhuri &#40;<a href="https://inspirehep.net/authors/992176?ui-citation-summary&#61;true&amp;ui-exclude-self-citations&#61;true">INSPIRE</a>&#41; at the <em>Raja Bazaar Science College</em>, Kolkata. </p> <h3 id=two_higgs_doublet_model_and_electroweak_pt ><a href="#two_higgs_doublet_model_and_electroweak_pt" class=header-anchor >Two Higgs doublet model and electroweak PT</a></h3> <p>I worked under Prof. Shinya Kanemura &#40;personal website <a href="http://www-het.phys.sci.osaka-u.ac.jp/~kanemu/index_eng.html">here</a>&#41; at Osaka University as an ISP student during the summer of 2024. I mostly looked into aspects of spontaneous symmetry breaking and the Higgs sector, specifically focusing on the <strong>baryon asymmetry issue</strong>. I investigated the effects of finite temperature on quantum field theories, particularly in the context of the <strong>two Higgs doublet model</strong> &#40;THDM&#41;, and looked at how this leads to the possibility of a phase transition at high temperatures &#40;in the early stages of the universe&#41;. Such phase transitions are necessary to satisfy the Sakharov conditions. I also considered two broad approaches to probing the feasibility of such models - namely, the loop corrections to the couplings using effective potential techniques that can be observed in collider experiments and the possibility of detecting GWs generated due to bubble collisions during the electroweak phase transition in such theories.

I read up on some of the existing literature on <strong>axion/photon coupling</strong>, specifically focusing on the consequences of the mixing and replicated <strong>polarisation-based studies</strong> - which essentially involves looking at how the properties of light from distant galaxies and astrophysical objects &#40;like quasars&#41; change when observed on Earth and how particles like axions could be responsible for such changes. This has both observational aspects and theoretical and/or computational aspects &#40;the latter of which is what I do&#41;.

Once linearised, the formalism is similar to the axion/photon case. Much of my project focused on similar polarisation changes in light that might result from such an oscillation phenomenon and how it might be applied to real-life observations. At present, I am looking into a certain class of extra-dimensional theories and how they might be related to these phenomena - this latter part of my work can be accessed in the arXiv preprint <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08396">here</a>. </p> <h2 id=nonlinear_systems_parametric_resonances_and_oscillators_spoiler_alert_lots_of_oscillators ><a href="#nonlinear_systems_parametric_resonances_and_oscillators_spoiler_alert_lots_of_oscillators" class=header-anchor >Nonlinear systems, parametric resonances and oscillators &#40;spoiler alert: <em>lots</em> of oscillators&#33;&#41;</a></h2> <p>At IACS, I worked with Prof. Jayanta K. Bhattacharjee &#40;who you can see on the homepage&#33;&#41; on nonlinear systems for around a year before he left for IIT, Kanpur, after which we collaborated &#40;and still collaborate&#41; online. Broadly, my work with him can be categorised into three separate intervals. </p> <h3 id=nonlinear_systems ><a href="#nonlinear_systems" class=header-anchor >Nonlinear systems</a></h3> <p>Initially, I worked on simple nonlinear systems and looked at some interesting aspects of their dynamics. As a fresh undergrad, this familiarised me with <strong><em>approximating techniques</em></strong>, <strong><em>differential equations</em></strong>, ideas like <strong><em>linearization</em></strong>, <strong><em>fixed points</em></strong> and so on. </p> <div class=row > <div class=container > <img class = "right" src="/Site/assets/phs.png" width = "250" height = "200"> <p style = "font-size: 15px"> As an example, I worked on a biquadratic potential for some time and looked into its time period which blew up in a certain case.

We identified four resonance conditions using perturbative techniques &#40;two of which, to the best of our knowledge, were not analysed in existing literature&#41;. We looked at the numerical solutions at resonance and briefly investigated the chaotic aspects of the system by computationally estimating the Lyapunov exponent. Unfortunately, due to the system&#39;s complexity, deriving an approximate analytical expression proved challenging. </p> <p>I presented our work on the elastic double pendulum at <strong>NODYCON 2023</strong>, held in Rome &#40;unfortunately, I had to present remotely due to personal constraints&#41;.

It has a very well-known resonance condition and its behaviour around this point is known &#40;in the linear order&#41;. Yet, the linear order solution diverges while the actual equation does not - we looked at the system perturbatively and found, surprisingly, that such finite solutions can be explained, even in undamped cases, by an interesting camaraderie between the amplitudes in various orders leading to a <strong>destructive interference like effect</strong> - just as in the case of light&#33; Furthermore, we found that the amplitude and the time period of the oscillations are drive-dependent and follow some interesting power laws - this only happens in a specific interval of drive magnitude after which the oscillator tends to become more and more messy - a first-order phase transition&#33; This work resulted in a peer-reviewed publication - you can find it <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1751-8121/ad6412">here</a>.

J. Sakurai&#39;s <em>Modern Quantum Mechanics</em>, in particular, is one of my favourite textbooks.
