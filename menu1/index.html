As a student at IACS, I explored two broad areas: nonlinear dynamics during my undergraduate years and particle phenomenology for my final two years BS-MS project work. <div class=row > <div class=container > <center><img src="/Site/assets/Presentation.jpeg" width = "300" height = "300"></center> <p style = "font-size: 15px">Final presentation at the ISP 2024, Osaka University. My presentation was non-technical to accommodate the diverse backgrounds of the audience. </p> </div> Here is a brief overview of the projects I&#39;ve undertaken over the last few years. You can find further details, including arXivs and reports, on the individual project pages:</p> <p>• <a href="/Site/axions/"><strong>Axion-like particles &#40;ALPs&#41; in various contexts</strong></a> - During the two years of my BS-MS project, my work revolved around specific consequences of the ALP-photon interaction term and its observational signatures, sometimes in simple models of the intergalactic magnetic fields and sometimes in RS models. Please visit <a href="/Site/axions/">this</a> page for more details.</p> <p>• <a href="/Site/thdm/"><strong>Electroweak phase transitions in the two Higgs doublet model</strong></a> - I was selected for the International Summer Program at Osaka University for the summer of 2024 where I explored electroweak phase transitions in the early universe, specifically in the two Higgs doublet model &#40;THDM&#41;, with a focus on how finite temperature effects can affect the possibility of baryogenesis. More details, as well as the project report, can be found <a href="/Site/thdm/">here</a>.</p> <p>• <a href="/Site/nonlin/"><strong>Nonlinear oscillators and parametric resonances</strong></a> - I worked on several nonlinear projects during my undergraduate years focusing on nonlinear oscillators and resonance. While seemingly different from my current particle physics focus, my training in nonlinear physics made me much more comfortable with a lot of mathematical techniques while also helping me build a computational base. For a description of the projects I undertook during this time and their outcomes, please visit <a href="/Site/nonlin/">this</a> page.</p> <p>• <a href="/Site/miscproj/"><strong>Other miscellaneous projects</strong></a> - This page describes a few brief side projects undertaken during my undergraduate years at IACS. These range from weak measurements in quantum physics to the solar neutrino problem and neutrinos.</p> <div class=page-foot > <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/">CC BY-SA 4.0</a> shihabulhaque.
